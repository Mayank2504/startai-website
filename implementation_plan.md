# Implementation Plan

[Overview]
Create an interactive multi-page web presentation for the AI Education Startup 1-year business plan using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

This implementation transforms the provided business plan document into an engaging, visually appealing static website hosted on GitHub Pages. The website will consist of multiple pages covering different phases and sections of the business plan, with intuitive navigation and interactive elements to enhance user experience and make the complex information more digestible. This approach allows for easy sharing, accessibility, and professional presentation of the startup's strategic roadmap, which is essential for stakeholder communication and potential investor presentations.

[Types]
No TypeScript or complex type system is required for this static website implementation.

Since this is a client-side only static website, no data structures or type definitions are needed beyond basic HTML data attributes for interactivity. All content will be static HTML with embedded styles and scripts.

[Files]
New HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files will be created to structure the multi-page presentation website.

Detailed breakdown:
- New files to be created:
  - startai-website/index.html: Main landing page with executive summary and navigation menu
  - startai-website/phases.html: Detailed pages for each of the four phases (Foundation, Launch, Growth, Consolidation)
  - startai-website/financials.html: Financial projections, investments, and revenue breakdowns with interactive charts

- Files to be deleted or moved: None
- Configuration file updates:
  - Create startai-website/.gitignore: Exclude node_modules if any development tools added later
  - Create startai-website/package.json: For potential build tools or development server

[Functions]
JavaScript functions will handle user interactions, navigation, and dynamic content display.

Detailed breakdown:
- New functions:
  - initNavigation(): Function in js/main.js to handle smooth scrolling and active menu highlighting
  - toggleSection(sectionId): Function in js/main.js to show/hide detailed content sections with animations

  - animateOnScroll(): Function in js/main.js to trigger CSS animations when elements enter viewport
  - updateProgress(): Function in js/main.js to show implementation timeline progress visually
- Modified functions: None (all new)
- Removed functions: None

[Classes]
CSS classes will define the visual styling and responsive design using Tailwind CSS framework.

Detailed breakdown:
- New classes:
  - .nav-menu: CSS class in css/styles.css for responsive navigation menu with hover effects

- Cross-browser testing in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Mobile responsiveness testing on various screen sizes
- Accessibility testing for keyboard navigation and screen readers
- Performance testing for page load times and smooth animations
